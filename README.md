# INST362_Website
This website was created for a class project. Alternative options were to use website builders, but they're mad restricting.

## How to run locally
Clone this repository and once it's downloaded, navigate to it in your terminal. Then, type these two commands:
```
npm i
npm start
```

`npm i` will install all dependencies that the project uses.
`npm start` will run the website locally.

After you're installed all dependencies, you can use npm start whenever you want.

## Making changes to the website
As of right now, you can change text by searching through components in the `components` folder. However, I'll update it so it's a lot easier soon-- a folder that contains all text in one place.
