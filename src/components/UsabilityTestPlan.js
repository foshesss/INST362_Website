            <h2>Who will we test with?</h2>
            <p>
                The focus group that we’re using for our test 
                is anybody that takes advantage of the 
                dining halls at UMD. We will be testing 
                users on the usefulness and quality of our app. 
                Our goal is to interview at least 10 people.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Good morning/afternoon/evening. 
                My name is [NAME], and I am a 
                student on team Wu Tang Flan working on 
                an app that reduces dining hall wait times 
                and food waste. [Also joining this session 
                are [NAME] and [NAME] who are on my team. 
                They are here to observe and take notes.]
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Thank you for agreeing to help us evaluate 
                our new dining hall app. Before we begin, 
                I’d like to give you an overview of the process 
                so you’ll know exactly what to expect.
            </p>

            <h2>Disclosures and Informed Consent</h2>
            <p>
                First, we are testing the design and not you. 
                We’re interested in your honest feedback and
                opinions, and there are no right or wrong 
                answers. Your answers will be confidential 
                and we won’t link your name to anything 
                that we discuss today.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                We will take notes, and will also be 
                collecting an audio and video recording 
                of this discussion. The recordings will 
                only be used for this study and will not be 
                released to anyone not involved in the research. 
                Is it okay with you if we record? [If yes, 
                start recording] 
                <br></br>
                Our discussion will last about [x] minutes.

            <h2>Warm up</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    How long have you been eating in the 
                    dining hall, and what has your experience 
                    been so far?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Do you get your needed meals throughout 
                    the day or tend to snack?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Does your schedule allow you to have 
                    sit down meals?
                </li>
                <li>
                    How do you feel about the ‘no take 
                    out food’ from the dining halls?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Would you use an app that gave you 
                    wait time estimates before class?
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is your personal experience with 
                    your experience at the dining halls at UMD?
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Transition to Test</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You'll be asked to perform a series of 
                    tasks. For each task, I will read a 
                    brief scenario and then ask you to 
                    use the [site or product] to find 
                    the answer or complete the task. 
                    We want to know how well the 
                    [product] works, and the best way to 
                    do that is to let you work through each 
                    task on your own without my help. 
                    However, I'm happy to clarify instructions 
                    and the purpose of the task, if needed. 
                    There may be times when I’ll ask you to 
                    explain why you said or did something.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To help me understand the way you would 
                    use the [product], I want you to  
                    think aloud as you complete the tasks. 
                    Talking aloud helps us understand 
                    your thought processes. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Scenarios and Tasks</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Check the menu at a specific diner</b>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                        Select a diner and find out what menu 
                        the diner is offering (breakfast, 
                        lunch, or dinner) and what specific menu 
                        items are available. What dietary 
                        restrictions are offered on 
                        specific menu items?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Sign up for food waste pick up</b>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                        Once you’ve selected a diner, try 
                        to sign up for food pick up at that 
                        diner. This will allow you to reserve 
                        a spot in the pick up line at the 
                        end of the day so that staff can 
                        get rid of unused food.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Ask a question in the diner chat</b>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                        In the same diner you selected, try to 
                        send a question to dining staff by 
                        using the “chat” section. Ask 
                        any question that you think might be 
                        important to know before 
                        coming into a dining hall.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Change an aspect of your profile</b>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                        Try to change a section of your profile, 
                        you can change your profile picture, 
                        your preferred names, pronouns, etc. 
                        Some information cannot be changed 
                        (Legal name, student ID number, DOB, etc).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Look for information about food waste at UMD</b>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, try to find some information 
                        about food waste at UMD and what UMD 
                        is trying to do to mitigate the amount 
                        of waste they produce.
