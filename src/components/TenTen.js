                During the design challenge section, our team quickly established our design challenge as finding an efficient utilization of dining hall resources. 
                Once this was agreed on we could fill in the rest of the chart and brainstorm assumptions, like the fact that certain foods get wasted more than others.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                The next section was the initial 10 ideas where we were supposed to think of the most out of the box concepts as possible. Some of these ideas included 
                displaying wait times outside of the diners so students could see when the best time to eat was and allowing students to eat for free after 9pm. 
                The idea we decided to expand on was allowing students to take food home since we thought it was the most viable and quickest solution out of the initial 10.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                After this, we had to create 10 variations of the idea we chose from the initial 10. Trying to find 10 variations of allowing students to take food home 
                wasn’t easy but we came up with ideas like sign-ups to get prepackaged meals, allowing staff to eat free at dining halls, and creating a special meal 
                plan that allows students to take food home.
