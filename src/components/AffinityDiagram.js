                <h3>Insights</h3>
                <p>
                    <span className='tab'/>Over the interview process we had many new and exciting pieces of information emerge. 
                    We found that UMD has plenty of student clubs and organizations that support food insecurity, 
                    food waste, and help other students in need on campus. As well as the fact that our dining 
                    halls are already taking green initiatives at different levels, and donating food waste to 
                    people in need. We also found out that although there are 5 dining halls on campus, students 
                    are still struggling with longer wait times in the little windows that they have in between their classes. 
                    A lot of this information we gathered from the interviews was somewhat of a shock to our 
                    group as we had higher and or lower expectations for specific areas of the UMD campus. 
                </p>

                <h3>User Needs</h3>
                <p>
                    <span className='tab'/>	Throughout the interview process, we have learned a lot. Originally, we had 
                    determined that the problem was food being wasted and that there were no programs to mitigate this. 
                    After interviewing the dining staff, we have learned that there are programs to tackle this problem. 
                    In specific, the Green Initiative and the Food Recovery Network. The Green Initiative is a program that 
                    makes sure food is sustainably sourced and the Food Recovery Network picks up some extra food to feed people. 
                    While these programs are beneficial, we discovered a new problem. They are completely reliant on volunteers, 
                    so if there are no volunteers, they cannot function. 
                    <br></br>
                    <span className='tab'/> In addition, we’ve also discussed with students, 
                    the primary users of dining halls on campus. We learned that they are upset with long lines and over-crowdedness. 
                    Some students are so upset about them that they even offered suggestions in an attempt to mitigate the problem. 
                    One solution that was given is to place a time limit on people eating in the dining halls– 
                    kicking them out if they exceed their allotted time.

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p>
                    <span className='tab'/>There are a lot of students who are unable to get food due to long wait times. Students have 
                    a very tight schedule with many being students and having responsibilities at work. This gives 
                    them very less time for eating. They don't have time to wait in lines so they have to get food 
                    from other places or just spend the day on chips. This is very inconvenient and expensive for students. 
                    While the students are unable to get food, there is a lot of food waste being produced from the dining halls. 
                    Some programs utilize the food waste in farms as fertilizers so that there is very less food that is 
                    actually wasted. But still, those leftovers cannot be served to students due to liability issues. The 
                    biggest pain point is that students are unable to get food while the food is being wasted.
                </p>

                <h3>Gaps</h3>
                <p>
                    <span className='tab'/>Our research thus far does not have many gaps, however the solution itself may have a gap between 
                    what is currently possible and what is required for the full solution. In order to close this gap 
                    we must educate people and implement new policies that reduce the waste of food and increase the 
                    availability of food for the students and community that rely on the dining halls as their main source of 
                    nutrition and meals. Through further education in what happens to our wasted food and unused resources, the 
                    problem of food waste and its byproducts can be greatly reduced and someday even extinct. 
                </p>

                <h3>Further research:</h3>
                <p>
                    <span className='tab'/>After conducting our research we discovered that there are a few more areas that we may need to focus on for this 
                    project. The main one being existing policy that may be affecting the amount of food waste that UMD produces. 
                    We also would like to do more research about UMD’s existing “green initiative” and how our research may be able to 
                    help lessen the load that volunteer workers have to carry at UMD. Overall we still have many questions left 
                    unanswered but we are definitely getting a better sense of direction regarding our research and where to go with it.
