                <p>
                    Food waste at the University of Maryland (UMD) 
                    is a growing problem. With the opening of the 
                    new dining hall, Yahentamitsi, lines have also 
                    never been longer. Because of such high traffic 
                    and limited dining hours, not enough people are 
                    getting to the food, which is causing food waste.
                     As this is a problem for many students on UMD’s 
                     campus, the Wu-Tang Flan™ is dedicated to finding 
                     potential solutions to this problem.
