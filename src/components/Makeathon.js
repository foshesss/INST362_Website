                We understood that there were many areas of improvement 
                and in order to tackle all of these we decided to create 
                an app that had a tab for both improving wait times in 
                the dining halls and reducing food waste. After conducting 
                our interviews we realized that students had no idea that 
                when walking into the dining hall that they would have to wait 
                in long lines in order to eat. This gave us the idea to create a 
                tab in our app that automatically updates during all open hours 
                to give you an idea of which dining halls are crowded and which 
                are not. This will reduce students not eating meals that will 
                sustain them as they can plan accordingly. Next, we realized that 
                although UMD dining services has created many programs and services 
                that reduce food waste there is still a lot that gets thrown away at 
                the end of the day. We created a portion of our app that displays the 
                menu at breakfast, lunch or dinning, and in those between hours 
                displays what food is available to pick up (in accordance to the 
                dietary restrictions you may have) in order to accommodate student 
                schedules and reduce food waste. We hope that this aids in decreasing 
                food waste, hunger and wait times for all students on campus.

            <h2>Brainstorming and Prototyping</h2>

            />
            <p>
                The first step of brainstorming was the 10+10 assignment 
                in which our group had to think of 10 ways to solve the 
                issue that our group was focusing on, in this case we were 
                focusing on inefficient use of food in dining halls and long 
                wait times. The first step of this was to think of 10 
                “out of the box” ideas to solve our problem (see img 1.2).
                Our group came up with ideas as simple as 24/7 dining halls 
                to allow students to eat whenever they want, and as 
                ambitious as having displays outside of dining halls to announce 
                wait times for students during peak hours. Finally our team decided 
                that the best idea out of the 10 that we came up with was to 
                allow students to take food out of the dining halls
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                The next step was to create 10 variations of this idea, 
                10 different ways that we could apply this idea in the 
                real world (see img 1.3). The goal of this is to see how 
                many different paths we could take to achieve our goal, 
                and one of the 10 ideas would become the blueprint for our 
                prototype later on in the class. We now had 10 possible routes 
                that we could take and this paved the way for the next step in 
                the brainstorming process.
            </p>

            <p>
                Once we had our 10 variation ideas, we had to select one 
                to use for the prototyping stage. Instead of using 1 idea, 
                we decided to use bits and pieces of multiple ideas for the 
                last step of the brainstorming process. We thought that asking 
                dining halls to hand out free food might be a far reach, and 
                we wanted to find a solution that was actually realistic in 
                terms of adoption from dining services. Instead of allowing 
                any students to take food home, we thought that dining 
                services could introduce a new dining plan that allowed 
                students to take food home. Of course this would cost more 
                than a normal dining plan, but it would definitely be popular 
                among students living in doors since after 9 the dining halls 
                close, so allowing a student to bring food home would be a handsome 
                offer for parents and students alike. Along with this new plan, 
                we wanted a way for students to be able to get information about 
                the dining halls without having to walk over to one, or ask 
                people who had already been there that day. This brings us 
                to the second part of our final idea.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                An app that would allow students to not only change their 
                dining plan, but also allow students to see the current 
                menu (breakfast, lunch, dinner), menu items being served 
                (along with the dietary restrictions), the wait times of 
                each dining hall, and an integrated chat room where students 
                can communicate with each other and dining hall staff 
                would solve a lot of issues that students have with the 
                dining hall experience. This app would allow students to 
                plan their dining hall visits directly from their phones. 
                This app paired with the new dining plan is what our team 
                decided to prototype and develop. After our interviews 
                with students and dining hall staff members, we think that 
                we found a solution that can solve multiple issues without 
                creating new ones. Once we had a final idea it was time to 
                brainstorm an app interface.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>      
                The first and current part of our prototype is a very rough 
                sketch of what the app’s user interface would look 
                like (see img 1.4). The app would let users select one 
                of the 3 dining halls on campus, and then show information 
                like the menu, dietary restrictions, etc. Wait times would 
                also appear for each dining hall so that students could plan 
                their trips to the dining halls accordingly. Lastly students 
                will be able to ask questions in a chatroom and dining hall 
                staff will be able to respond to students, so questions like 
                “are there anymore xxxx” can be answered by staff instead of 
                through word of mouth.

            <h2>Thoughts About Testing</h2>
            <p>
                Our main goal is to reach as many people as 
                possible, and utilizing an application on student’s 
                phones that helps to streamline the process of the 
                dining hall will help to achieve this. Our prototype 
                hopes to give the student as a user more optimization 
                and efficiency in their dining plan, which will lead 
                both to quicker dining hall experiences and reduction 
                in food waste. Our features such as estimated wait time, 
                dining menu and menu availability will surely help further 
                our plan to redesign the dining experience at UMD campus as a whole. 
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                Although our application will not actually be functional 
                or created as the prototype, seeing the layout and 
                included features of our app will allow the testers 
                to determine whether or not this can be a solution to our 
                problem. We can have the tester rate the application in many 
                areas such as features, layout, clarity and efficiency in comparison 
                to the current dining layout. We can also further our understanding 
                of the dining experience through more interaction with testers and 
                feedback on our prototype, to ensure that the target audience gets 
                what they are asking for.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                We plan to use the prototyping phase as a tool for feedback 
                in our plans and progress, as well as to reshape any necessary 
                feature to work even better for the user in the final product.
